# Massachusetts School Project with Tableau

## Project description

For this project we used *TABLEAU* to analyse education data of the state of Massachusetts, build a report to show the school board the state of the school system and answer the following questions:

* What schools are struggling he most?
* What are the top math schools in the state?
* How does class size affect college admission?

To adress these questions, we used [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover) to analyse and visualize the data. During the project we used the following tableau features:

-  Connecting to Data;
-  Creating a bar chart
-  Adding color
-  Creating a scatter plot
-  Adding size
-  Adding label
-  Adding tooltip
-  Creating pie chart
-  Creating line chart
-  BAN / KPI / Metric
-  Reference Line

## Analyses

We upload our csv file to tableau public to analyse and visualize the data and address the questions to present to the board of the school.

### 1\. What schools are struggling he most?

To answer this question we built a bar chart to find out the bottom 10 schools with the lowest graduation rate. We created a bar chart where the graduation percentages are displayed for each school. The **bar chart** below we can see the schools that are struggling the most.

### 2\. What are the top math schools in the state?

The school board wanted to find out what the top math school was in the state. They believed that 4th grade math is key to a student's feature and would like to focus on improving the state's MCAS 4thGrade Math passing grade. They wanted to know which districts were above the desired threshold of 50% and would like to collect the names of these districts to invite some of these teachers to train the rest of the state on how they improve math scores.
### 3\. What are the top math schools in the state?
