# Massachusetts School Project with Tableau

## Project description

For this project I used *TABLEAU* to analyse education data of the state of Massachusetts, build a report to show the school board the state of the school system and answer the following questions:

* What schools are struggling he most?
* What are the top math schools in the state?
* How does class size affect college admission?

To adress these questions, I used [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover) to analyse and visualize the data. During the project I used the following tableau features:

-  Connecting to Data
-  Creating a bar chart
-  Adding color
-  Creating a scatter plot
-  Adding size
-  Adding label
-  Adding tooltip
-  Creating pie chart
-  Creating line chart
-  BAN / KPI / Metric
-  Reference Line

## Analyses

We upload our csv file to tableau public to analyse and visualize the data and address the questions to present to the board of the school.

### 1\. What schools are struggling he most?

To answer this question we built a bar chart to find out the bottom 10 schools with the lowest graduation rate. We created a bar chart where the graduation percentages are displayed for each school.
