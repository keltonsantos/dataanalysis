In this project I will analyze the loans and credit of IDA-World Bank Program, and answer the following questions:

* What are the Top 10 debtors of IDA
* How much did Cape Verde disburse from 2012 to 2022?
* How much does Cape Verde owe to IDA?
* What are the Top 10 Cape Verde Projects by amount disbursed?
